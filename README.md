# YOLOX_Training_Custom_DataSet
Megvii researchers have cleverly integrated and combined outstanding progress in the field of object detection such as decoupling, data enhancement, anchorless and label classification with YOLO, and proposed YOLOX, which not only achieves AP that surpasses YOLOv3, YOLOv4 and YOLOv5Â , but also achieved a very competitive reasoning speed. As this is very recent development in YOLO Series; one may face some issues while adapting this model on their custom dataset. In this post, we will walk through how you can train YOLOX to recognize object detection on your custom image Dataset.
